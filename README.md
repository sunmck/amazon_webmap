## Workflow
The Web App was developed using Esri's ArcGIS Pro and ArcGIS online. These are license-based GIS softwares. The performed workflow is visualised in the following flowchart:

First, multiple data sets relevant to the study area and aim of the application were downloaded both from open-access online resources and from the ArcGIS Online Layers, i.e. features hosted by ArcGIS Online. Data acquired from other sources were reprojected to EPSG:3857 reference system using ArcGIS Pro. 
Then, a Web Map was created using ArcGIS Online. All layers that had been downloaded from open-access online resources were uploaded to ArcGIS Online whilst further ArcGIS Online Layers were directly integrated into the map. All layers were grouped into the main categories Biodiversiy, Environment, Socioeconomic and Drivers of Change and Threat and further sub categories. This should later make the usage of the Web App more intuitive and neat. Furthermore, the different layers were styled, either categorized by attribute or just visualised with appropriate colouring. Lastly, the layers which should be visible when starting the application were toggled visible.
